    Executes a self-contained Python script.

    EFFICIENCY GOAL: Use this tool to consolidate multi-step workflows. Instead of making sequential calls to simpler tools (like `read_file`, `shell`, or calculators), write a single Python script that handles the file I/O, data processing, and calculations all at once.

    CRITICAL ENVIRONMENT RULES:
    1. STATELESS: Variables, imports, and functions DO NOT persist between calls. Every script must be completely self-contained.
    2. END-TO-END: The script should perform the complete task internally and use print() to output the final, processed result.

    (Note: You may still use this tool multiple times to debug errors or explore data, but ensure each script is independent.)

    Available libraries: numpy, polars, scipy, openpyxl, pyyaml, tomllib, requests and the python standard library
